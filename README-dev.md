# Diamagnetic Calculations Explained

#### This document serves as an introduction to diamagnetic contribution calculations. The section is divided into several chapters. The first chapter briefly explains the concept of diamagnetic susceptibility. The subsequent chapters discuss several examples of chemical compounds for which the diamagnetic contribution has been calculated. To illustrate these computations, we will start with the simplest example and gradually increase the level of difficulty in the following chapters.
